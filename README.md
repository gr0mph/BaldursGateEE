# BaldursGateEE

Welcome to this wiki page.

On this page you will find cheese cheats to play Baldur's Gate 1 & 2. Based on the exploits listed on the fandom site baldur's gate.

When playing the game Baldur's Gate, the game is terribly difficult even on easy difficulty. However, there are countless exploits that make this game very accessible.

Playing without cheese is simply impossible, a beginner will use the fog of war, the no cheater the garden of Mutanin. The only viable solution is to play with cheeses.

On this page, you will have the best builds with scripts based on the accessible cheats of the game. This page is not made for no cheaters, after all we will never be able to compete in cheating the garden of mutanin and the cape of Algernon.

Some cheeses are much nicer by modifying the game files to be made with the Near Infinity engine. On this github project, you will have access to the modified files.

A current habit of game development is to leave out the 2 biggest cheats of the game but to close/fix the more fun and lesser known cheats of the game. It's a terrible clumsiness but it's a fact. It inherently decreases the quality of the game, we can't really remove the Mutanin gardens so we can't really remove the other cheeses. These clumsiness force a little more to use Near Infinity to overcome these flaws.
