# BaldursGateEE

The swashbuckler fighter is the best fighter in Baldur's Gate 1 & 2. You need to create K_FT_E file, to add kit in multiclass via Near Infinity engine. K is for Kit, FT for fighter thief and E for Elf. If you wish create an another multiclass, check If the multiclass is enable and kit is enable for the specific race via CLSRCREG (all this file is 2DA).

## Advantage

+1 bonus to armor class at the start and +1 bonus every five levels (+6 AC bonus at level 25/28).
+1 bonus to-hit and damage every five levels (+5 at level 25/28).
Weapon specialization can be update via WEAPPROF file 2DA folder (else use no cheater mode and do a Berserk dual class Mage and get out)
Backstab like a thief and better than a stalker.

From this advantage, the swashbuckler fighter has a great thaco, a great ac (even the best AC in the game), a great damage. Can kill in one time an enemy or can trap adversary (stalker cannot).

## Choose the weapon

As lich is immune to spell weapon +0/+1/+2/+3. We need in early Baldur's Gate 2 a weapon that can hit a lich (with the golem, its the only creature that need really fighter to kill it easily). In Baldur's Gate 2 EE, that is few weapon that can hit in the start a lich (finally it is simple to know what weapon must be selected for the fighter thief.

Once this list has been done, we notice that there is only three weapon with backstab: Long sword (1/8), Scimitar (1/8), Short sword (1/6), Quaterstaff (1/6) that can hit easily in start of Baldur's Gate a lich. Despite Katana (1/10) can be choosen with Fury Celest a very good weapon, the Fighter thief can not kill in the start of the game the lich.

Elf has one bonus to hit with long sword and short sword.
Single weapon style add -1/-2 bonus to armor class. 

In Baldur's Gate 1, with a short sword in one hit, you can already reach 100 damage.

## Reach the best Armor class

As said in the wiki of Baldur's Gate, there is three AC. You can reach -20 AC in general AC, -8 AC in uncapped general AC (dexterity and single weapon style), situationnal AC (improved invisibility and protection from evil), type AC.

With the swashbuclker, it's more easy to reach -20 with his -6 bonus.
