# BaldursGateEE

The lathander ranger is a good character that gives an important role play in RPG with detect evil spell and can be a good support for thieves with the spell detect trap. Otherwise, spell and missing exploit with spell cannot defy a mage, combat without swashbuckler passive ability or enrage ability like berserker and barbarian cannot defy equally a pure fighter. But for the roleplay, it is nevertheless a good character. The Lathander ranger still a dangerous warrior that can sleep than smash an enemy, can blind with holy smite, poison, hold, charmed an enemy. The lathander give a good advantage again undead with hold undead spell that is THE solution against undead. The ranger can charm easily wild or summoned creatures. Best thing, the ranger can hide, get closer an enemy, done boon of lathander and strike with 5 attacks per round in Baldur's Gate 1.

In Baldur's Gate 2, the Ranger can reach 85% of piercing, slashing, crushing resistance with Defender of Easthaven (Flail, Copper coronet, Joluv), Armor of faith (Level 1 Divine spell), Hardiness (High Level Ability Fighter Innate spell).

## Advantage

Charm animal (Ranger without archer kit gives this innate ability that is pretty, surely more important than called shot).
Hold undead (Lathander priest have this very powerful spell that smash lots of undead, don't forget that ranger charm animal, priest hold monster, humanoid and gianthumanoid, If you have a solution for each GENERAL, your hero can survive)
Boon of Lathander (For each Boon, +1 THACO, SAVING THROW, DAMAGE, APR and immunity to drain level, this spell is very pretty)
Stealth (Despite that Ranger cannot Backstab, put snare, it can hide with a leather armor, like a role playing with cleric, it increase this roleplay).

Finally Cleric cannot wear bow (short,long and cross), slashing and piercing weapon. But the most dangerous enemy can have good resistance in previous, it's not the same for crushing damage that is very important against undead, jellyfish. Indeed, Cleric can access to sling missile weapon that is a good missile weapon. The 1 APR is largely compensated with Boon of Lathander.

## Choose the weapon

Ranger need Defender of Easthaven, and Defender of Easthaven need flail. Weapon of the ranger is flail. In Mutanin Garden, you can easily kill a group in the middle of area with a magical mroningstar, that can be replace with a Flail +2 at the beginning of chapter 5.
A fighter need a missile weapon, like said you can have only two missile weapon, the sling and the warhammer. If you choose the warhammer, you should update CLSRCREQ 2DA file to add dwarf in Ranger cleric possibility. If you choose the sling, you could choose an halfling for its +1 THACO bonus with sling. You can start the game with sling, it's not the case with throwing warhammer. Dwarf and halfling has shorty saving throws bonus that is very important for a non mage build. To add Dwarf and halfling cleric ranger, update CLSRCREQ 2DA file.

A great Flail or Morningstar is present in Durlarg Tower, but in fact not. To win and also again Sarevok, you need a throwing weapon, and this weapon is cursed so absolutly not easy to switch with a weapon missile.

## Choose your spell

Priest spells are slow, not very disabling, less combinable than mage spells, with effects that can be canceled under saving throws, and with less damage. In addition, spell exploits are present for mages but absent for priests. This makes druid priests, clerics, rangers, paladins much less dangerous than mages. Nevertheless, a philosophy seems to be emerging in D&D 2, which is the priest casts a spell then strikes. This works well for example with Boon, Reach 5 APR, Command, smash! It is not comparable with Globe, Web, done or Backstab, done but there is a nice side!
