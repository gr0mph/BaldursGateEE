# BaldursGateEE

The lathander ranger is a good character that gives an important role play in RPG with detect evil spell and can be a good support for thieves with the spell detect trap. Otherwise, spell and missing exploit with spell cannot defy a mage, combat without swashbuckler passive ability or enrage ability like berserker and barbarian cannot defy equally a pure fighter. But for the roleplay, it is nevertheless a good character. The Lathander ranger still a dangerous warrior that can sleep than smash an enemy, can blind with holy smite, poison, hold, charmed an enemy. The lathander give a good advantage again undead with hold undead spell that is THE solution against undead. The ranger can charm easily wild or summoned creatures. Best thing, the ranger can hide, get closer an enemy, done boon of lathander and strike with 5 attacks per round in Baldur's Gate 1.

In Baldur's Gate 2, the Ranger can reach 85% of piercing, slashing, crushing resistance with Defender of Easthaven (Flail, Copper coronet, Joluv), Armor of faith (Level 1 Divine spell), Hardiness (High Level Ability Fighter Innate spell).

## Advantage

Charm animal (Ranger without archer kit gives this innate ability that is pretty, surely more important than called shot).
Hold undead (Lathander priest have this very powerful spell that smash lots of undead, don't forget that ranger charm animal, priest hold monster, humanoid and gianthumanoid, If you have a solution for each GENERAL, your hero can survive)
Boon of Lathander (For each Boon, +1 THACO, SAVING THROW, DAMAGE, APR and immunity to drain level, this spell is very pretty)
Stealth (Despite that Ranger cannot Backstab, put snare, it can hide with a leather armor, like a role playing with cleric, it increase this roleplay).

Finally Cleric cannot wear bow (short,long and cross), slashing and piercing weapon. But the most dangerous enemy can have good resistance in previous, it's not the same for crushing damage that is very important against undead, jellyfish. Indeed, Cleric can access to sling missile weapon that is a good missile weapon. The 1 APR is largely compensated with Boon of Lathander.

## Choose the weapon

Ranger need Defender of Easthaven, and Defender of Easthaven need flail. Weapon of the ranger is flail. In Mutanin Garden, you can easily kill a group in the middle of area with a magical mroningstar, that can be replace with a Flail +2 at the beginning of chapter 5.
A fighter need a missile weapon, like said you can have only two missile weapon, the sling and the warhammer. If you choose the warhammer, you should update CLSRCREQ 2DA file to add dwarf in Ranger cleric possibility. If you choose the sling, you could choose an halfling for its +1 THACO bonus with sling. You can start the game with sling, it's not the case with throwing warhammer. Dwarf and halfling has shorty saving throws bonus that is very important for a non mage build. To add Dwarf and halfling cleric ranger, update CLSRCREQ 2DA file.

A great Flail or Morningstar is present in Durlarg Tower, but in fact not. To win and also again Sarevok, you need a throwing weapon, and this weapon is cursed so absolutly not easy to switch with a weapon missile.

## Choose your spell

Priest spells are slow, not very disabling, less combinable than mage spells, with effects that can be canceled under saving throws, and with less damage. In addition, spell exploits are present for mages but absent for priests. This makes druid priests, clerics, rangers, paladins much less dangerous than mages. Nevertheless, a philosophy seems to be emerging in D&D 2, which is the priest casts a spell then strikes. This works well for example with Boon, Reach 5 APR, Command, smash! It is not comparable with Globe, Web, done or Backstab, done but there is a nice side!

Command
Casting time 1
Bypass magic resistance NO
Bypass mirror image YES
“ This spell enables the priest to command another creature to "die" (sleep) for a single round. At the end of the round, the creature awakens and is unharmed. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Spell to ignore the command. ”

Like said, it's the best spell from level 1 to 4 for a Cleric spell. Cast in good timing, can kill a dangerous enemy.

“ This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. This includes: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 4 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison. ”

With a bad casting time, this spell is nevertheless a best spell for cleric.

Holy smite
Casting time 3

“ This spell calls upon energy from the Positive Energy Plane in order to open a channel between it and the targets. The result is that any evil creatures within the spell's area of effect take 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster, or half damage upon a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell. If the victims fail their Saving Throw, they are also blinded for 1 round. ”

This spell can be compared of a mage spell, Blind is a must have effect, and decent damage, a very good casting time. The only and best spell level 3. And indeed, other spell has been tested and doesn't work Miscast magic (saving throw negate), Summon insect (very too slow).

Mental domination
Casting time 4

“ When cast upon a subject, the subject must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty in order to avoid the priest entering his/her mind. The effects of this spell are similar to those of the wizard spell Domination, with a few minor differences. Most notably, this spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. The priest simply is able to command the subject to perform certain tasks or functions during the spell's duration. To control the subject, the priest must be within range and must be able to see the subject. This control will last until dispelled or for the duration of the spell. ”

With a bonus saving throw, a decent casting time, this spell is very good.

Poison (spell)
Casting time 4

“ Through this spell, the caster can poison victims who fail their Saving Throw vs. Poison. The damage inflicted depends on the level of the caster as detailed below:

    7–9th level: 2d8 + 2/round
    10–12th level: 3d8 + 3/round
    13–14th level: 4d8 + 4/round
    15–16th level: 6d8 + 5/round
    17+ level: 8d8 + 6/round

Those who make their Saving Throws are unaffected. ”

A decent casting time, good damage, this spell maybe cool. Nevertheless, need more test because saving throws versus can ignore the damage.
